> What is N-gram? <br>
  > An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive items in a text, such as words, symbols, numbers, or punctuation. N-grams are a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and are used in many text analytics applications


## Data Collection
> For every project data collection is a very important part. Researchers spent most of the time to collect the data also pre-process data. In order to collect the data, I used [SEART](https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch/) website. By using this website anyone can collect any amount of github repositories. For this project, I only choose those repo which has at least **5000** commit.
> After collecting the repositories, I've saved it in a csv file. After that I used **Python Script** to extract only java code from the repositories and saved all the files into docx file.
